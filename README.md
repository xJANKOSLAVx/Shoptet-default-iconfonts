# Shoptet-default-iconfonts
Simple overview of default icon fonts, on individual templates, on the Shoptet palatform.  It is used to make it easier to work with minor modifications of templates.

Defacto it's a simple cheat sheet I created for myself to make me comfortable to work with. And so I don't have to search or add icons that are already in the template ready in the base.
